What is happening?
stuff = list(): Creates an empty list. This is like getting an empty box where you can store items.

stuff.append('python'): Adds the string 'python' to the list. So now, the list looks like ['python'].

stuff.append('chuck'): Adds 'chuck' to the list. Now the list is ['python', 'chuck'].

stuff.sort(): Sorts the list alphabetically. After sorting, the list becomes ['chuck', 'python'].

print(stuff[0]): Prints the first item of the sorted list, which is 'chuck'.

Why? Because after sorting, 'chuck' comes before 'python'.
print(stuff.__getitem__(0)): This does the same thing as stuff[0], but it's a more "under-the-hood" way to access the first element. The __getitem__ method is what Python uses internally when you write stuff[0].

print(list.__getitem__(stuff, 0)): Another way to access the first item of the list, using the __getitem__ method from the list class directly. This is the equivalent of the previous line, but here we're calling the method from the list class explicitly and passing the stuff list and the index 0.

Summary:
The program creates a list, adds two strings, sorts them, and then prints the first element three times (using different ways to access it). Each of the last three lines will print 'chuck'.
